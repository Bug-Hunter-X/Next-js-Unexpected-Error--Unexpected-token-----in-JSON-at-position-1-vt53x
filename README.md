# Next.js Unexpected Error: Unexpected token '.' in JSON at position 1

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications related to data fetching and asynchronous operations within page components.  The error, "Unexpected token '.' in JSON at position 1," typically arises when a page component attempts to access data from a promise before it has resolved.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to directly use the result of a promise without properly handling the asynchronous operation.  This often results in undefined behavior or the aforementioned JSON parsing error.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring all asynchronous operations are handled correctly using `async/await`.  The `aboutSolution.js` file shows the correct implementation.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nextjs-unexpected-token-error`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

You can then observe the corrected behavior in the `/about` page.
